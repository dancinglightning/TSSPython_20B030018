# Basic git and GitHub
## Introduction
Git is a Version Control System which helps you collaborate and work with other programmers on projects easily.
So now the question is what is a Version Control System?
Version Control is a system that records all the changes you do to your files and logs them.
This enables you to go back to them and start working on your files from that point.
It's basically like time travel.
If while working on your files you realise that you have done something majorly wrong but can't sit and undo every change.
The best option for you is to ask your version control system to simply go back to the instance from where you want to start again.

As you can see, having a version control system has a lot of benefits.
It helps to keep track of previous versions of your code.
On the other hand, GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Getting Started
The first step is installing git on your system.
