# Basics of Dart and OOPS
Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.
First, you need to get an introduction to Dart and Object Oriented Programming Concepts. It will be very easy if you have basic programming knowledge (CS101).

### Text Editors for Dart
These are some text editors which you can use for writing and running dart programs. Two of them are web based and run on your browser, but need no setup, the third is offile and needs to be set up.
* **[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true "DartPad")** (Browser based)
* **[Repl.it](repl.it "Repl.it")** (Browser based, needs signing in)
* **Visual Studio Code** (requires setup, for steps - [click here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dart-installation-and-setup-in-visual-studio-code/ "Set-Up VS Code"))

## Basics of Dart
The Dart programming language is a general purpose programming language developed by Google. It is widely used at Google and the basis for Flutter development. The syntax of Dart is very similar to Java and C++. Therefore, the object oriented language is very approachable for developers with knowledge in other programming languages. This tutorial will teach you the basics of dart e.g. Variables, Data Types, Operators, Loops, Conditional Statements and Functions.

## Object Oriented Programming
Dart is an object-oriented programming language, and it supports all the concepts of object-oriented programming such as classes, object, inheritance, mixin, and abstract classes. As the name suggests, it focuses on the object and objects are the real-life entities. The Object-oriented programming approach is used to implement the concept like polymorphism, data-hiding, etc. The main goal of oops is to reduce programming complexity and do several tasks simultaneously. The OOPs concepts are given below 
* Class
* Object
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Interfaces
* Abstraction
