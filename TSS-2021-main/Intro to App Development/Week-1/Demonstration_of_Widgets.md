# Demonstration of Widgets through a Flutter App

There are various tutorials available on Introduction To Flutter and almost all of them provide a really good start to Flutter. But this tutorial by **Net Ninja** is really a good one for beginners.

Link to the [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ)

This playlist contains 35 videos of a short duration. But you need not watch all the videos during the first week itself. For week one content you may start from the 4th video and watch till 15th video.
For quickly brushing up your **Dart** concepts you can also watch the third video.

## Detailed description of the videos:
* Video 1-2: Installation
* Video 3: Basics of Dart
* Video 4-9: Text, Image, Icons, Buttons and some more widgets are covered in detail
* Video 10-14: Containers, Rows, Columns and their properties are covered.
* Video 15: A simple project using the widgets learned.

Do read the [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) side by side to learn more about these widgets. Please watch these videos carefully and implement what you've learned side by side as these are the basics of flutter which you'll be using throughout the course.

Have a good learning experience:)
