# Assignment for week 4

Phew !! Finally done with the week 4 material (the last one )!! This is the last assignment of this course (your last step towards that certificate).

This Assignment is divided into 2 parts:

## Part 1: Creating a simple login page:
 
For this you will need to Integrate your Firebase console with your App and choose any one of the Sign-in methods under authentication. Something like this:

After this you will need to start working on your App by taking inputs from the users such as email and password (username also incase the user is not registered). This input can be taken using Form and creating TextFormFields under them or just by creating simple TextFields. After taking the input from the user you will need to pass it on to the Firebase using different methodes such as signInWithEmailAndPassword (Depends on the type of Sign-in Method you have chosed)

The interface will look Something like this (Subject to changes as per the coder's wish):

- Please remember that since there are 2 images given you wont need to create 2 screens, this can be done in ***1 screen*** by creating a boolean variable.


## Part 2: Creating a TODO app:

In this part you will develop the previous application further by adding more functionality and a screen to it.

The extra addition will be a Todo screen to the app which can look something like this (Subject to changes as per the coder's wish):
 - <img src="todo-app.png" height=400>

So for adding and deleting Todos ie Performing CRUDS (Create, Read, Update, Delete) you will need to create a firestore post. <br>
