# Assignment for Week 2

So for this week to showcase ***Encapsulation*** and other properties we will be developing a Quiz App. Now you might be thinking how can ***Encapsulation*** in a quiz app.
Well if a user is using your app and has access to the ***main.dart*** file he can certainly change the answers and question numbers too, which we dont want. So in this assignment 
you will have three files along with ***main.dart***, One will contain the a ***class to store the question and answer for one particular question objects*** and the other one will have a 
***class for storing all the questions***. The Interface and a demonstration video is shown below.

Notice that we have an Icon bar at the bottom to tell whether the answers are correct or wrong and resets after the questions are over.
