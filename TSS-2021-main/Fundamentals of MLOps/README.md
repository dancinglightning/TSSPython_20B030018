# Fundamentals of MLOPs: A hands-on approach 
### <div align="center">[TSS - 2021]</div>

Ever wondered how organizations build, deploy, maintain, adapt, retrain & redeploy large-scale AI-powered applications?   
In today's fast-paced industry, maintaining & deploying scalable applications while being able to adapt quickly to the changing consumer requirements is of utmost importance. 

## ***WnCC & Career Cell bring to you a course on Fundamentals of MLOps!***  
Through this course, you will be introduced to some of the core ideas behind combining the long-established practices of DevOps with the emerging field of Machine Learning. You will be exposed to the various stages of the ML model lifecycle, including data versioning, experimentation, evaluation & monitoring. To consolidate these principles, you will also get an opportunity to build & deploy end-to-end ML pipelines by leveraging various ML Operations Management tools.

**Pre-Requisites:** Reasonable understanding of Python, Traditional ML Algorithms & Performance Metrics  
**Course Duration:**  4 weeks  
**Time Commitment:** 8-10 hrs per week (1-2 hrs more for optional material)
### Schedule:   
Week 1: Overview & Motivation for MLOps, ML Workflow Lifecycle, Real-world MLOps Case-Studies  
Week 2: Dataset & Model Management using Data Version Control (DVC)  
Week 3: ML Experimentation using PyCaret  
Week 4: Deployment & Monitoring using PyCaret & MLFlow   

_Material (Tutorials, References & Documentation) to be released weekly, along with weekly tasks for students to implement all that they have learned through the week's material_

### Assignments:  
Each of the 4 weeks will have certain assignments which build on top of the previous week's assignment. Through this series of 4 assignments, the audience can gain hands-on experience in creating, monitoring & versioning end-to-end ML pipelines using the libraries introduced to them during the respective weeks. 
***Submission of all 4 weekly assignments is mandatory for obtaining a certificate since all these are integral to the learning intended from this course***
